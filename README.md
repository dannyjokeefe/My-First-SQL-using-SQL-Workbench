# My-First-SQL-using-SQL-Workbench
This is my very first SQL Workbench containing the syntax's i learnt along the way.
# SQL Workbench Learning Project

This project is a compilation of my SQL learning journey using **SQL Workbench/J**. I practiced all fundamental SQL operations to understand how to query, manipulate, and analyze data efficiently.

## 📚 Learning Focus

Through structured practice, I covered:

- Writing clean and optimized SQL queries
- Filtering and aggregating data
- Joining tables and understanding relationships
- Using subqueries and common table expressions

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- 🔎 **SELECT Statements**: Retrieving specific columns and rows using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- 📊 **Aggregate Functions**: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` with `GROUP BY`
- 🔄 **Joins**: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`
- 🧩 **Subqueries**: Writing nested queries for advanced filtering
- 🧮 **CASE Statements**: Creating conditional columns
- 🛠 **Table Management**: `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `DROP`
- 📂 **Schema Understanding**: Analyzing relationships between tables
- ✏️ **Commenting & Formatting**: Writing readable and maintainable SQL code
